      Poem Variation 1</h1>
    <h2>Untitled (Freedom is it!), from Inflammatory Essays</h2>
    <h3>by Jenny Holzer, 1979-82</h3>
    <div class="bodytext">
<p>Freedom is it! You’re so scared,</p>
<p>You want to lock up everybody.</p>
<p>Out to kill? Maybe yes. Is law,</p>
<p>Is order the solution? Definitely</p>
<p>No. What caused this situation?</p>
<p>Lack of freedom. What happens</p>
<p>Now? Let people fulfill their</p>
<p>needs. Is freedom constructive</p>
<p>Or is it destructive? The</p>
<p>Answer is obvious. Free people</p>
<p>Are good, productive people.</p>
<p>Is liberation dangerous? Only</p>
<p>When overdue. People aren’t</p>
<p>Born rabid or berserk. When</p>
<p>You punish and shame you cause</p>
<p>What you dread. What to</p>
<p>Do? Let it explode. Run</p>
<p>With it. Don’t control or</p>
<p>Manipulate. Make amends.</p>
