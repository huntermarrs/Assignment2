  <br>Freedom is it!</br>
  <br>You’re so scared, you want to lock up everybody.

  <div class="questions">

    <br><i>Are they mad dogs?</i>
    <br><i>Are they out to kill?</i>
      </div>
    <br>Maybe yes.
    <br>
    <br>
      <div class="questions">
    <br><i>Is law, is order the solution?</i>
</div>
    <br>Definitely No.
    <br>
    <br>
      <div class="questions">
    <br><i>What caused this situation?</i>
</div>
    <br>Lack of freedom.
    <br>
    <br>
      <div class="questions">
    <br><i>What happens now?</i>
</div>
    <br>Let people fulfill their needs.
    <br>
    <br>
      <div class="questions">
    <br><i>Is freedom constructive or is it destructive?</i>
</div>
    <br>The answer is obvious.
    <br>Free people are good, productive people.
    <br>
    <br>
  <div class="questions">
    <br><i>Is liberation dangerous?</i>
</div>
    <br>Only when overdue.
    <br>People aren’t born rabid or berserk.
    <br>When you punish and shame you cause what you dread.
    <br>
    <br>
      <div class="questions">
    <br><i>What to do?</i>
</div>
    <br>Let it explode.
    <br>Run with it.
    <br>Don’t control or manipulate.
    <div class="bodytext" id="end">

    <br>Make amends.
